<p>Crate &amp; Barrel uses Helvetica Bold as their logo font, with a modified “C”. Helvetica is a font that uses straight line letters and uses a smaller line used to finish off a main stroke of a letter. I can tell that the box is helvetica font because the a has a tear drop shape and the straight line of the r.</p>
