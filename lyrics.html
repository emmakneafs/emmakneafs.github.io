        <h1>"Not A Bad Thing"</h1>

        <h3>by: Justin Timberlake</h3>

        <h2>[Verse 1]</h2>

        <p>Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
        And every tomorrow, maybe you’ll let me borrow your heart
        And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
        And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start</p>

        <p>I know people make promises all the time
        Then they turn right around and break them
 When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, and you're bleeding
        But I could be that guy to heal it over time
        And I won’t stop until you believe it
        'Cause baby you’re worth it</p>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

        <p>So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
        'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true, with me
        Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
        So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me</p>

        <h2>[Verse 2]</h2>

        <p>Now how about I’d be the last voice you hear tonight?
        And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
        Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
        'Cause I know that’s a good place to start</p>

        <p>I know people make promises all the time
        Then they turn right around and break them
        When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, and you're bleeding
        Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
        And I won’t stop until you believe it
        'Cause baby you’re worth it</p>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>

        <p>So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
        'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true, with me
        Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
        So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
        (Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)</p>

        <p>No I won’t fill your mind
        With broken promises and wasted time
        And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
        These arms of mine</p>

        <h2>[Chorus]</h2>
        <p>Don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
        'Cause you might look around and find your dreams come true, with me
        Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
        So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
        Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me </p>
